# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge and understanding of different programming languages and their applications. This project involves creating a comprehensive Expense Tracker application in Java. The goal is to showcase my ability to write clean, functional, and object-oriented code in Java while leveraging its extensive libraries and frameworks.

# Description

The Expense Tracker application is designed to help users manage and track their daily expenses. It allows users to add, display, and calculate their total expenses. By creating this software, I aimed to deepen my understanding of Java's syntax, data structures, and object-oriented programming principles.

# Purpose

The purpose of writing this software is to deepen my understanding of the Java programming language, particularly focusing on its syntax, object-oriented features, and file I/O operations. By building a practical application like an , I aimed to apply various language concepts in a real-world scenario.

# Development Environment
For the development of this software, I used the following tools:

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IntelliJ IDEA
- Java Development Kit (JDK): JDK 17
- Build Tool: Maven
- The primary programming language used is Java. I utilized the Java Collection Framework, specifically the ArrayList class, to manage the list of expenses.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that were particularly helpful during this project:

- Java—Wikipedia
- Java Tutorial—W3Schools
- Java Reference—Oracle
- Java Collection Frameworks—BeginnersBook

# Future Work

There are several improvements and features that I plan to add to the Expense Tracker application in the future:

- Implement data persistence to save and load expenses from a file or database.
- Add categories to expenses to provide more detailed insights into spending habits.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more user-friendly.
- Include charts and graphs to visually represent spending patterns.
- Add the ability to set budgets and provide alerts when nearing budget limits.
